All designs in this repository are released under GPL-3.0 licence. Feel free to use and adapt them to your heart's desire. The only ask to refrain from mass-production and commercialisation of PCBs/modules, as I rely on PCB sales for funding new module designs. If you use (parts of) my designs in your own modules, please credit me on your schematics and PCBs to help users find the original creator. I call upon your good conscience to make fair use of my work shared here.

# Support
If you like the resources I have made available here, and wish to support the development of new modules, feel free to buy me a few components through a small donation. I mainly design modules for fun, but you probably already know it can be a costly endeavour. All small contributions help me, thank you very much!
